## 🚨 CRITICAL: Mobile-First Priority

> **Most users (70%+) will access the website from mobile devices.**

This is the most important design principle. Every decision must prioritize the mobile experience:

- **Design for mobile first**, then scale up to desktop
- **Mobile booking flows** must be frictionless and complete in under 2 minutes
- **Touch targets** minimum 44px height
- **Sticky CTA** visible after scrolling past hero on mobile
- **Forms** optimized for mobile keyboards (correct input types)
- **Images** optimized for mobile networks (WebP, lazy loading)
- **Navigation** slides in from side on mobile
- **Content** readable without zooming (16px minimum body text)
- **Performance** - LCP under 2.5 seconds on 3G

If it doesn't work on mobile, it doesn't work.
